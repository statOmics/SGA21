Introduce a single-cell paper, and let them download the data and manuscript.

By using the OSCA book and after seeing our general workflow, let them analyze the single-cell dataset.

Goals:

 - Perform appropriate EDA and QC
 - Create an appropriate, parsimonious visualization of the structure in the data
 - Let them find out that clusters may not be the best way to summarize the structure, as a trajectory may be present
 - Then introduce trajectory inference in next lecture
 
Goals 2:

 - Implement different feature selection methods seen in lecture
 - Evaluate them through visualizing structure of the data.
 - How correlated are the selected features?
